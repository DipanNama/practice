                    Maintaining a high productivity level is hard. Sometimes lines of
                    code don’t come easy, you feel anxious and unable to concentrate.
                    The good news is that there’s a huge English-speaking coding
                    community on the net that you can learn from.

                    If you are a junior developer, you should discover what’s best for
                    you and apply your personal best productivity hacks early on. Even
                    if you have years of coding experience, it’s never too late to try
                    new habits because there’s always a chance that the old ones no
                    longer serve you.

                            your editor like the back of your hand. What’s the quickest way to find a class or refactor
                            a method? What’s the quickest way to modify a text file (learn regex). Don’t reinvent the
                            wheel.</p>
                        <p><span>Know all of the libraries available </span>in the language(s) of your choice and how to
                            use them. Force yourself to write an example with each library. Keep those examples handy,
                            so you can review them whenever needed. Once you’re familiar enough with a library,
                            a) you’re more likely to remember to use it when the opportunity strikes and
                            b) you’re more likely to know how to use it and, therefore, resist the temptation to spin
                            your own.” – Puneet Lamba (LinkedIn profile)</p>
